At first what are server links, these give you the option to add in the pause screen of the user links which he can
click. For example the own marketplace, website of the server, etc.

There are two things which can be used that are build in options, what will be quick and but not much configuration
options available. The other option are TextComponents there you can create and style like you want.

## Enable server links

At first server links needed to be activated this will be done then you add to your `config/config.toml` this text:

```toml
# /config/config.toml

[server.server_links]
# Enable server links feature
enable = true
```

This is added below the server configuration. Also to deactivate temporarily you can set enable to false.

## Build-in server links

You have 10 build in types for server links these are:

- `bug_report`
- `community_guidelines`
- `support`
- `status`
- `feedback`
- `community`
- `website`
- `forums`
- `news`
- `announcements`

The only special case is `bug_report` this will be also displayed then the server breaks or throws an exception or send
malformed data to the client.

This can be used like this:
```toml
[[server.server_links.links]]
label = "bug_report"
url = "https://github.com/4lve/SteelMC/issues"
```

and a full example:
```toml
# /config/config.toml

[server.server_links]
# Enable server links feature
enable = true

# Built-in link type (simple string label)
[[server.server_links.links]]
label = "bug_report"
url = "https://github.com/4lve/SteelMC/issues"
```

## Custom server links
These are TextComponent So you have a lot more functionality included here for the design with custom text and color.
This will look like this:
```toml
[[server.server_links.links]]
label = { text = "Visit the SteelMC Discord", color = "blue", bold = true }
url = "https://discord.gg/suSXXNdVSf"
```
### Additional resources
In the web you can find many more tutorials about TextComponent and how to use them correctly
